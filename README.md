# Digital Audio & Synthwave Production from First Principles

Welcome to building synthwave from the ground up! This project takes you from basic digital audio concepts to creating your own flexible music production tools.

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Digital Audio Fundamentals
- How sound becomes digital (sampling, quantization)
- Working with raw audio data
- Basic wave generation (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle)
- Understanding frequency, amplitude, and phase

### Phase 2: Audio Programming Basics
- Generating tones and simple melodies
- Audio effects from scratch (reverb, delay, distortion)
- Real-time audio processing
- MIDI concepts and implementation

### Phase 3: Synthwave Elements
- Classic analog synthesizer emulation
- Characteristic synthwave sounds:
  - Warm analog-style oscillators
  - Resonant filters
  - Chorus and analog delay
  - Gated reverb
  - Arpeggiators and sequencers

### Phase 4: Custom Production Environment
- Building your own flexible DAW concepts
- Real-time parameter control
- Audio routing and mixing
- Export and production workflow

## Tools We'll Build
- Basic oscillators and waveform generators
- Digital filters (low-pass, high-pass, band-pass)
- Effects processors (reverb, delay, chorus, distortion)
- Step sequencer
- Simple mixer and routing system
- Real-time visualization tools

## Why This Approach?
Instead of being limited by pre-built DAW interfaces, you'll understand exactly how each component works and can modify or extend anything to match your creative vision.

## Getting Started
Run the setup script to install dependencies and create your first digital audio program.
